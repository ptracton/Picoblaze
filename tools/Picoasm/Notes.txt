  1) BUG: constants whos first letter is 's' will be assumed to be registers and produce incorrect instructions.
   - Fix was to  add test to getRegiseter method
 
    if ( name[ 0 ] != 's' || name.length() <= 1 || name.length() > 2)
		return -1 ;
    : NOTE: still not good enough .  Cannot have a 2 letter constant which begins with 's'..
